# MongoDB Spark Connector 

The official MongoDB Spark Connector.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mongodb/mongo-spark.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mongodb/mongo-spark)

## Documentation

See: https://docs.mongodb.com/spark-connector/

[API Documentation](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.mongodb.spark/mongo-spark-connector_2.11)

## Downloading

The connector is published on [Spark packages](https://spark-packages.org/package/mongodb/mongo-spark), the community index of third-party packages for [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/). The binaries and dependency information for Maven, SBT, Ivy, and others can also be found on
[Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3Aorg.mongodb.spark).

## Support / Feedback

For issues with, questions about, or feedback for the MongoDB Spark Connector, please look into
our [support channels](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/support/). Please
do not email any of the developers directly with issues or
questions - you're more likely to get an answer on the [mongodb-user](https://groups.google.com/group/mongodb-user) discussion forum.

At a minimum, please include in your description the exact version of the driver that you are using.  If you are having
connectivity issues, it's often also useful to paste in the Spark configuration. You should also check your application logs for
any connectivity-related exceptions and post those as well.

## Bugs / Feature Requests

Think you’ve found a bug? Want to see a new feature in the Spark driver? Please open a case in our issue management tool, JIRA:

- [Create an account and login](https://jira.mongodb.org).
- Navigate to [the SPARK project](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SPARK).
- Click **Create Issue** - Please provide as much information as possible about the issue type and how to reproduce it.

Bug reports in JIRA for the driver and the Core Server (i.e. SERVER) project are **public**.

If you’ve identified a security vulnerability in a driver or any other MongoDB project, please report it according to the
[instructions here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/create-a-vulnerability-report/).

## Versioning

The MongoDB Spark Connector does not follow semantic versioning. The MongoDB Spark Connector version relates to the version of Spark.

For example:

  * [Mongo Spark Connector 2.1.x](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-spark/tree/2.1.x) supports Spark 2.1.x
  * [Mongo Spark Connector 2.2.x](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-spark/tree/2.2.x) supports Spark 2.2.x

Major changes may occur between point releases may occur, such as new APIs and updating the underlying Java driver to support new features.
See the [changelog](./doc/7-Changelog.md) for information about changes between releases.
